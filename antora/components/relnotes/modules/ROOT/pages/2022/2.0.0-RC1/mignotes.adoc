[cols="2a,3a", options="header"]

|===

| previously
| new

| `@DomainService.logicalTypeName` deprecated for removal
| use `@Named` or any other semantics supported by Spring
+
Behavioral change: `@DomainService.logicalTypeName` can now be left empty, which is interpreted as _unspecified/indifferent_ 

| `RecreatableDomainObject` interface removed
| use `ViewModel` interface instead

| `ViewModel.viewModelInit(String memento)` removed
| use a single (String) argument constructor instead; this will allow Java Records to be used as viewmodels (future work)

| `MetamodelEvent` as provided with _metamodel_ moved
| moved to _applib_; we introduced _interface_ `MetamodelListener` for convenience to maybe use instead
[source, java]

@Service
public class SeedService implements MetamodelListener {
/..
    @Override
    public void onMetamodelLoaded() {
