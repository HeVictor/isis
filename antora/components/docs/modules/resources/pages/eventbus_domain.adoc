When an Action is invoked or a Property is changed, events are published via the bus.
This implies that DomainEvents have been declared on the member before?

We call the change of a DomainObject's Property or the invocation of a DomainObject's or DomainServices' Action an Execution.
Executions are broadcast as events on the event-bus.
The framework provides several publisher/subscriber models to listen for specific execution data (readonly).
In addition developers can declare Domain Events specific to Actions, Properties and Collections, that allow event listeners to modify visibility (whether is visible) or usability (whether can change).
In addition there are UI Events, that allow listeners to modify the viewer's use of title, icon, css-class and layout file.
The event-bus is provided/managed by Spring.

event listener can check: visibility (hide), usability (disable), validity (validate) ... aka "see it, use it, do it".
It can also listen to executing (before) and executed (after).
